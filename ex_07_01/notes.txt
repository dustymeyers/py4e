- a file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence
- We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence
- Rember a sequence is an ordered set 

```
  xfile = open('mbox-short.txt')
  for cheese in xfile:
    print(cheese)
```

- Open a file read-only
- Use a for loop to read each line
- Count the lines and print out the number of lines

```
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)

$ python3 open.py 
Line Count: 132045
```


- We can also read the whole file into a single string

```
>>> fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
>>> inp = fhand.read()
>>> print(len(inp))
94626
>>> print(inp[:20])

- We can put an if statement in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria

```
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
```

Outcome:

```
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za\n
\n 
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu\n
\n
From: zqian@umich.edu\n
\n
From: rjlowe@iupui.edu\n
\n
```

- Print adds a separate new line
  - rstrip allows us to remove white space
- instead we should do:

```
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From:'):
        print(line)
```

Outcome:

```
From: stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
From: louis@media.berkeley.edu
From: zqian@umich.edu
From: rjlowe@iupui.edu
```

- We can conveniently skip a line by using the continue statement

```
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From:'):
      continue
    print(line)
```

- We can look for a string anywhere in a line as our selection criteria

```
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
        continue
    print(line)
```

- Example of file input with try catch for bad file name
- quit() will immediately kill the program not allowing anything else to be executed

```
fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File cannot be opened:', fname)
    quit()

count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count = count + 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lines in ', fname)
```
