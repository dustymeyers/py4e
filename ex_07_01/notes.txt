- a file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence
- We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence
- Rember a sequence is an ordered set 

```
  xfile = open('mbox-short.txt')
  for cheese in xfile:
    print(cheese)
```

- Open a file read-only
- Use a for loop to read each line
- Count the lines and print out the number of lines

```
fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count = count + 1
print('Line Count:', count)

$ python3 open.py 
Line Count: 132045

```


- We can also read the whole file into a single string
